            The prompts will also give simple form like journal with entries

        <ol>
            <li>Recapitulation - what did I do and how did I get there?</li>

        <h4>Essence of entering each of 
            <a href="http://leighb.com/jhanas.htm">the 8 Jhanas:</a>
        </h4>
        <p>0. Follow Breath until access concentration is established:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Thoughts are wispy in the background,</li>
            <li>b. and/or White light glows in the background,</li>
            <li>and/or Breath becomes very shallow or disappears.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>1. Switch attention away from the breath to a pleasant physical sensation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Stay focused on the 'pleasantness' of the pleasant sensation,</li>
            <li>b. Do not do anything else by stay focused on the 'pleasantness', it
                will increase in intensity automatically.
            </li>
            <li>c. When the <strong>physical pleasure and emotional joy/happiness</strong>
            rises, focus on that experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>2. Focus on the emotional joy/happiness that is accompanying the intense physical
            sensations of the 1st Jhana:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Push the intense physical sensations into the background -
                taking a deep breath now will be helpful in doing this,
            </li>
            <li>b. Stay one pointedly <strong>focused on the joy/happiness.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>3. Turn down the intensity of the joy/happiness to 
            <strong>contentment/satisfaction</strong>
        </p>
        <p>4. Let go of the pleasure of the contentment/satisfaction and drop down to a 
            <strong>quiet, still equanamity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>5. Sense the "boundaries of your being" and begin expanding them outwards: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a. Expand outwards until you fill the room,</li>
            <li>b. Expand outwards until you fill the building,</li>
            <li>c. Expand outwards until you fill the neighborhood,</li>
            <li>d. Expand outwards further and further, remain focused on expanding outwards,</li>
            <li>e. When a <strong>boundless space</strong> opens up before you, switch your focus to it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>6. Realizing that it takes a <strong>boundless consciousness</strong> 
            to be aware of a boundless space, switch your attention to your consciousness of the 
            boundless space.
        </p>
        <p>7. Switch your attention from the boundless consciousness to the content of that
            consciousness - it will be a sense of no thing - <strong>no-thing at all</strong>
            anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>8. Let go of all the previous outward sensing and come to rest in a small spot 
            more or less between the eyes a few inches from your face. Focus on being in 
            <strong>a state that has no characteristics.</strong>
